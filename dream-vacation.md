My dream vacation would involve a long list of destinations and experiences I'd like to have, but there would be no fixed itinerary. Many of the destinations and experience ideas would likely be pulled from shows and films I've watched or books I've read, and I would want a variety of time spent in the city and in quieter places. I would want to have enough time to relax. Perhaps I would want to start learning a new language and use the experience to practice speaking or reading.
